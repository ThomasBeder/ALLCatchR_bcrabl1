Description: Molecular disease subtype and immunophenotype are important prognosticators in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Up to 26 molecular subtypes are acknowledged as distinct diagnostic entities (WHO-HAEM5 / ICC). RNA-Seq identifies all subtypes, however requesting defined analysis workflows for routine diagnostic application are lacking. To leverage the potential of systematic gene expression analysis, we developed ALLCatchR, a machine-learning based classifier using RNA-Seq count data to allocate BCP-ALL samples to all gene expression defined molecular subtypes. Training Trained on n=1,869 transcriptome profiles with genomic established subtype definitions (3 cohorts; 55% pediatric / 45% adult) enabled ALLCatchR to perform subtype allocation in 3 independent hold-out cohorts (n=1018; 75% pediatric / 25% adult) with 95.7% accuracy (averaged sensitivity: 91% / specificity: 99%; remaining ‘unclassified’: 1%). Based on a newly established RNA-Seq reference of human B-lymphopoiesis (7 FACS-sorted differentiation stages), ALLCatchR defines proximities between BCP-ALL subtypes and lymphoid differentiation.
